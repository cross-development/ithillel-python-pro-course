"""
This module defines the WithdrawalHandler class, which extends the TransactionHandler
and is responsible for handling withdrawal transactions.

The WithdrawalHandler processes withdrawal transactions by:

- Withdrawing the requested amount from the account balance.
- Printing a confirmation message with the new balance.

The handler then optionally passes the transaction to the next handler
in the chain for further processing (e.g., logging).

"""
This module defines the PurchaseHandler class, which extends the TransactionHandler
and is responsible for handling purchase transactions.

The PurchaseHandler processes purchase transactions by:

- Withdrawing the purchase amount from the account balance.
- Printing a confirmation message for the successful purchase.

The handler then optionally passes the transaction to the next handler
in the chain for further processing (e.g., logging).

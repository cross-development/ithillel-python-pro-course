Comparison of PostgreSQL and MongoDB for a To-Do List application:

1. **Schema Structure:**
   - PostgreSQL enforces a strict schema.
   - MongoDB allows flexible documents.

2. **Data Integrity:**
   - PostgreSQL supports foreign keys, transactions, and ACID compliance.
   - MongoDB does not enforce strict relationships but offers flexibility.

3. **Performance:**
   - PostgreSQL is efficient for structured queries and large datasets.
   - MongoDB is optimized for fast document retrieval.

4. **Scalability:**
   - PostgreSQL scales vertically by improving hardware.
   - MongoDB scales horizontally across multiple nodes.

5. **Ease of Use:**
   - PostgreSQL requires pre-defined table structures.
   - MongoDB allows adding fields dynamically.

**Conclusion:**
For structured data and transactions, PostgreSQL is the best choice.
For flexible, fast-growing datasets, MongoDB is more convenient.
